## PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
  I have been asked by the CEO of PyBer to compile and analyze the companies ride share data in relation to urban, suburban and rural areas across multiple cities.
  
## Resources
  * Data Source 1: city_data.csv
  * Data Source 2: ride_data.csv
  * Software: Pyhton 3.9.2 64 bit, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4

## Results
  Compliling the ride share data from multiple city types has revealed that urban areas receive the most ride share fares.  Urban areas have a 1625 total rides followed by suburban areas at 625 rides and rural areas at 125 rides.  The number of rides seems to correlate with the number of drivers.  Urban areas have 2405 drivers which could account for the higher number of rides given.  Suburban areas have 490 drivers and rural areas have 78 drivers.  Total fares also show highest in urban areas at $39854.38.  Suburban areas totaled $19,356.33 and rural areas totaled $4,327.93.  Although urban areas have the highest number of rides and drivers, rural areas show the highest average fares per ride at $34.62.  This is trailed by suburban areas at $30.97 and urban areas at $24.53.  Fare per driver is also increased in rural areas giving them an average of $55.49.  Suburban areas see an average fare per driver of $39.50 and urban areas show $16.57.

  Using the chart below you can see the correlation of total ride fares per city type.  The data dictates that urban areas see the highest total fare out of the three city types with rural city types seeing the lowest.

## Summary
  Given the supplied data I can suggest some ideas to help increase the fares in the lower performing areas.  The first is to give driver incentives to drivers in rural areas to help increase the availability of rides if there isnt a current program in place.  To help drive demand for rides in rural areas the company could also offer discounts for mileage traveled or reapeat business.  The company could also introduce a refferal program for customers to receive an incentive for getting thier friends and families to use PyBer.  These suggestions could help increase the amount of rides in rural areas, however, they could also easily be applied to both urban and suburban areas to help drive business demand in all areas.
